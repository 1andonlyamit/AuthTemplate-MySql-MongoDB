# AuthTemplate-Mysql-Mongodb-
Hii, Amit here 
In this mini project:

I have created Login and Signup functionality Template.
You will get both Mysql & MongoDB connection.
I added JWT authorization too.
Sooner i will be adding email verification.

It will be very useful for places like hackathons or somewhere 
where you are havin less time to develop so you focus more on 
Main functionalities instead of wasting time on Login and Signup.

I also added an excalidraw file so you can also create a project 
or template like this, as i have covered full development Journey
in that.
